# 2dEngine
Got Bored, made a 2d engine


I'm sort of following a guide/ sort of not, just using it to establish base lines. Often times I will deviate from the guide while making this.

## Goals
Learn more about javascript itself.
Remember some physics and learn to implement math and physics in code.
Hopefully make something fun out of the engine that's created.

## To Run
```
Install the extension Live Server.
Right click index.html and run as Live Server.
```
